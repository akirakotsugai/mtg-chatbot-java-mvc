This is a telegram bot developed in Java to aid Magic: The Gathering players during a match. It was created for academic purposes, more specifically as an assignment for a Software Engineering subject.  For those who are wondering where "Robot Chicken" come from, our bot was named after an existing Magic: The Gathering card. The idea of creating a bot to help players out was originally brought up by a member of our group, @emaiax, whose experience in playing this card game and coming across conflicts among numerous cards suggested that something should be done to aid casual players in facing such a problem in the absence of a referee. On top of that, our bot can be useful in some other ways listed below.

##Features

- Find any "Magic: the Gathering" card of any set of cards;
- Basic card attributes provided by the bot;
- Possibility to see a card picture;
- Check out all official rulings belonging to a card whenever the players are trapped in a conflicting situation;
- Foresee releases of upcoming sets and their details;
- Other under development features are coming soon...
